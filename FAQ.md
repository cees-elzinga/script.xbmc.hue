"Use all lights" doesn't work for me
------------------------------------

If the add-on is configured to "Use all lights", bulb number 2 has a special function. This bulb is "leading", ie the settings from this bulb are used for the whole group. Make sure this light is turned on when you start XBMC. If not, the add-on thinks the complete group is turned off.

The script.xbmc.hue.ambilight version allows you to override the leading light in the advanced settings panel.
